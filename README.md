Graceful degradation and service workers are closely related because service workers help ensure that an application continues to function even when some modern features like network connectivity are unavailable. With graceful degradation, we build a fully featured app using the latest technologies and then ensure it still works—at least in a basic way—when those features fail or aren't supported. Service workers support this approach by enabling offline access, caching essential resources, and handling fetch failures gracefully. This allows the core experience of the site to remain usable even in degraded conditions, aligning directly with the principles of graceful degradation
